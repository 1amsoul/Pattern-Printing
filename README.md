# ⭐ Pattern Printing in Java(DSA Journey)

This repository contains a collection of **pattern printing programs in Java**, practiced as part of my **DSA learning journey**.  
These patterns helped me strengthen my basics in:

- Nested loops  
- Conditional logic  
- Iterative problem-solving  
- Understanding space & alignment in patterns

## 📂 Patterns Covered

### 🔹 Star Patterns
- Solid Rectangle  
- Hollow Rectangle  
- Half Pyramid  
- Inverted Half Pyramid  
- Full Pyramid  
- Rotated Half Pyramid (180°)

### 🔹 Number Patterns
- Incremental Number Pyramid  
- Decremental Number Patterns  
- Other basic variations

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How nested loops work together  
- How to use conditions to control pattern borders  
- How spaces and alignment create shapes  
- Logical thinking + loop visualization
